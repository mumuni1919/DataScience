    "### Definition:\n",
    "Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variables. In essence, multiple regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression because it involves more than one explanatory variable.\n",

    "The meaning of each column is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "id: a number between 0 and 100000 that is a unique identifier for each house. Do not use this in your algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "zipcode: Each house has a zipcode corresponding to the area the house is in. The zipcode can be an indicator of build year or other properties. There are four different zip codes in use: 3520, 3525, 3525, 3800.\n",
    "\n",
    "lot-len: the length in meters of the plot of land the house is built on. Each house is built on a square plot of land. It can be anything from 5.0 to 100.0 meters\n",
    "\n",
    "lot-width: the width in meters of the plot of land the house is built on. It can be anything from 5.0 to 100.0 meters\n",
    "\n",
    "lot-area: the total area of the plot of land the house is built on. You can probably compute this from lot-len and lot-width.\n",
    "house-area. The living area of the house in square meters. 30.0 square meters is a tiny house, 200.0 square meters would be a mansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "garden-size: The size of the garden in square meters. Many people want to have a large garden.\n",
    "balcony: the number of balconies the house has. Common values are 0,1, or 3 balconies\n",
    "\n",
    "x-coor: the x-coordinate describing the location of the house. It is an integer value between 2000 and 3000\n",
    "\n",
    "y-coor: the y-coordinate describing the location of the house. It is an integer value between 5000 and 6000\n",
    "\n",
    "buildyear. The year that the house was built. Some of the oldest houses are from 1100,, but most houses were built in the 2oth and 21st century.\n",
    "\n",
    "bathrooms: Most houses in Utrecht have one bathroom. Some houses have 2 or 3 bathrooms\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output/target values:\n",
    "**\n",
    "taxvalue: The taxvalue of the house is a number between 50.000 and 1.000.000 that is a conservative value of the house. It is estimated (often based on real housing data) by the government to determine taxes. In a calm market, it is close to but often slightly lower than the retail value. It is rounded to the nearest 100 euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "retailvalue: the market value of a house. It is a number between 50.000 and 1.000.000. It is rounded to the nearest 1000 euros.\n",
    "\n",
    "energy-eff: This value is either 0 or 1. If it is 1 it means that the house is energy efficient. This is important for certain climate goals of the city of Utrecht\n",
    "\n",
    "monument: Some houses in Utrecht, especially older houses, have monumental value since they have a unique architectural design. People have been trying to predict if this is the case from other data, since it is timeconsuming to visit each house and inspect the architecture\n",

    "\n",
    "OLS is a method for estimating the unknown parameters in a linear regression model. OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the target dependent variable and those predicted by the linear function. In other words, it tries to minimizes the sum of squared errors (SSE) or mean squared error (MSE) between the target variable (y) and our predicted output ( \n",
    "^\n",
    "y\n",
    " ) over all samples in the dataset.\n",

    "OLS can find the best parameters using of the following methods:\n",

    "* Solving the model parameters analytically using closed-form equations\n",
